# Wikipedia Treasure Hunt

The project is currently being hosted on GitHub Pages: https://joseph-flinn.github.io/wiki-treasure-hunt/

## Dependencies
- npm 6.14+
- node 


## Setup
Whenever using `npm`, I would highly suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to 
manage the currently used version of `node`. This allows for clean maintainance for different
node projects on the same computer.

`npm run start`
